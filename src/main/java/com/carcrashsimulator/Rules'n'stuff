Player controls traffic lights
- lights change colours when clicked on
- cars spawn randomly and drive (later in random directions)
- loss if traffic jam or crash occurs
- win if certain time is reached without loss conditions
Additions: different intersection levels, air conditions, improved driving AI
Since the assignment is vague, AI will be simple - just driving forward, later will do turns.

Score - count of seconds passed. Win - 120 points
Spawn rate: TBD
Traffic jam: 10 cars in lane

Operations:
1. Add Car to lane list
1.1. if lane list size < 3, spawn Car, else wait until spawned cars move out (spawn 3rd car) every time the first one leaves
2. Once Car is spawned, check distance to the car before it
2.1. move Car if distance allows it
3. Once traffic light turns green, all spawned cars behind it move
3.1. Once the car reaches traffic light, PathTransition changes, car is removed from the lane
4. Car object is on its own during drive through intersection
5. At the end of intersection crossing the car joins exit lane and either:
5.1. Car reaches a car that's waiting and stops behind it
5.2. car moves until end of PathTransition and despawns
